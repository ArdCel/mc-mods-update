--if you are the server owner--
inside path.cmd you will see a link, somewhere in the link there is 
"CHANGE/THIS" 
you need to change that with your repo: for example https://github.com/R2Northstar/Northstar would be R2Northstar/Northstar


to edit cmd/bat files you can:
1: change cmd extension with .txt and when you are done change it back to .cmd
2: Install notepad++
3: tell North to do it himself and give it back to you


--if you are installing the mods--
locate your minecraft folder (usually .minecraft) 
Commands will do the rest
